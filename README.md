# Performance Task

## About:

Node.js backend, Express Server, PostgresSQL database

React frontend with Redux state management

The carousel is built using the pure-react-carousel npm package. 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/pure-react-carousel

## Instructions:

1. `npm install`
2. `createdb innovare-ism`
3. `npm run seed`
4. `npm run start:dev`
5. navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
6. browse the site!

## Notes:

The homepage redirects to /dashboard.

The header component _Header.js_ is currently for display only. The user and notifications information will be connected to a logged in user once that functionality is built out.

The views for the milestone list, single view, create, and edit components are only somewhat styled. I chose to focus more on functionality and offer enough styling to get an impression of where these components might wind up, once a designer gives it their touch.
